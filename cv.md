# About Me
I am a 6th year student at the Faculty of Radio Engineering. Since my second year of study, I realized that I was interested in programming. The specialty of my studies, unfortunately, does not fully correspond to this interest. Therefore, around that time, I began to study additionally on my own, and recently I was enrolled in courses at RS School.
